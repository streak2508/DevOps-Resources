## _A few basic commands to know if you are learning essentials for DevOps_
+ ### Overview of Linux and Why it is so Popular?

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that runs on a computer and controls all of the other software and hardware on the computer. Initially, Linux was built on the Unix operating system, which was created many decades ago as a platform for scientific and academic computing. It is used on a wide range of devices, including servers, desktop computers, laptops, cloud computing, and Mobile devices.

As Linux is open-source software anyone can access its source code and make changes to it. Other than this Linux is known for its Security features. It has a large community of users and developers who are constantly working to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. Also, Linux is well known for its Customizability allowing users to modify and configure it to meet their specific needs.


 * ###  Organization of Linux File System

In Linux, the file system is organized into a hierarchical structure, with the root directory (/) at the top of the hierarchy. The root directory contains several subdirectories, each with its specific purpose that forms the foundation of the Linux file system hierarchy. The subdirectories include:

/bin - contains essential command-line utilities that are required for the system to function

/boot - contains files needed for booting the system including the Linux kernel and boot loader configuration files

/dev - contains device files that represent various devices and hardware components on the system

/etc - contains configuration files for the system and various applications

/home - contains the home directories for individual users

/lib - contains libraries needed by the utilities in /bin and /sbin

/media - a mount point for removable media such as CDs, DVDs, and USB drives

/mnt - a mount point for temporarily mounting file systems

/opt - contains third-party software packages

/proc - A virtual file system that contains information about the system's process and kernel

/root - the home directory for the root user

/sbin - contains system executables, similar to /bin

/sys - A virtual file system that provides an interface to the kernel's device drivers

/tmp - Contains temporary files that can be deleted by the system when space is needed

/usr - contains user utilities and libraries as well as data shared by multiple users

/var - contains variable data such as log files, mail spools, and database files
